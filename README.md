# internet :)

This package contains a server and client for historical searches in bgp dumps. I'm not sure where this is going so for the moment this package is named internet to postpone the definition.

The first two things to be implemented are more ports of the core functionality of  https://github.com/CIRCL/IP-ASN-history and https://github.com/CIRCL/ASN-Description-History .
